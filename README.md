This is a fork of the HsQML package by Robin KAY:

  http://www.gekkou.co.uk/software/hsqml/

I heavily modified it to use template haskell for class declarations.
Additionally, it supports emitting Qt signals from Haskell code.
There is also some preliminary support for implementing non-context
objects from Haskell.
